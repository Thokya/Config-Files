* Xmonad -
xmonad is a dynamically tiling X11 window manager that is written and configured in Haskell. In a normal WM, you spend half your time aligning and searching for windows. xmonad makes work easier, by automating this.

* What is a Tiling Window Manger ?
In computing, a tiling window manager is a window manager with an organization of the screen into mutually non-overlapping frames, as opposed to the more popular approach of coordinate-based stacking of overlapping objects (windows) that tries to fully emulate the desktop metaphor.

So after endlessly scrolling through reddit and finding a thread called "r/unixporn" I got mesmerized agter seeing the amount of customization we can do after a base linux installation and had to try it so here's my first configuration file or so called "rice or ricing" (as called in r/unixporn) I've used Xmonad for the tiling window manager and you customize almost everything in Xmonad Tiling Window Manager.

Along with Xmonad I've dicided to use Xmobar for the status bar as Xmonad by default doesn't have any status bar (actually once you login into Xmonad you get a black screnn like literally) 

What is Xmobar ?
Xmobar is a lightweight, text-based, status bar written in Haskell. It was originally designed to be used together with xmonad, but it is also usable with any other window manager. While xmobar is written in Haskell, no knowledge of the language is required to install and use it.

So there are plenty of Tiling window managers and status bar you've must have got question why did I use Xmonad and Xmonad along with it. One for as it is Exceptionally fast, it has many of the shortcuts which we can use (and almost you can say bye-bye to your mouse kiddin!!) it also supports multi-monitor setup so if you are one those using mutli-monitor setup one more reason to use Xmonad.

You are free to use my config files for the build as on my build it works perfectly fine with a compostor and the terminal emulator (the terminal emulator of my choice is kitty - https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/, you can also find kitty on Arch repositories and many other) of my choice. The distro I've been using is "Ubuntu".

so yeah that's it!!!! Enjoy and Happy ricing!!
