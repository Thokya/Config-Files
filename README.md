# Config-Files

* Xmonad -
xmonad is a dynamically tiling X11 window manager that is written and configured in Haskell. In a normal WM, you spend half your time aligning and searching for windows. xmonad makes work easier, by automating this.

* What is a Tiling Window Manger ?
In computing, a tiling window manager is a window manager with an organization of the screen into mutually non-overlapping frames, as opposed to the more popular approach of coordinate-based stacking of overlapping objects (windows) that tries to fully emulate the desktop metaphor.

So after endlessly scrolling through reddit and finding a thread called "r/unixporn" I got mesmerized after seeing the amount of customization we can do after a base linux installation and had to try it so here's my first configuration file or so called "rice or ricing" (as called in r/unixporn) I've used Xmonad for the tiling window manager and you can customize almost everything in Xmonad Tiling Window Manager.

Along with Xmonad I've dicided to use Xmobar for the status bar as Xmonad by default doesn't have any status bar (actually once you login into Xmonad you get a black screnn like literally) 

What is Xmobar ?
Xmobar is a lightweight, text-based, status bar written in Haskell. It was originally designed to be used together with xmonad, but it is also usable with any other window manager. While xmobar is written in Haskell, no knowledge of the language is required to install and use it.

So there are plenty of Tiling window managers and status bar you've must have got question why did I use Xmonad and Xmonad along with it. One for as it is Exceptionally fast, it has many of the shortcuts which we can use (and almost you can say bye-bye to your mouse kiddin!!) it also supports multi-monitor setup so if you are one those using mutli-monitor setup more reason to use Xmonad.

# UPDATE:
So after uploading this repo over Github time has passed we're in 2021 already and things have changed and here's a brief update over my config files there are some changes made to the config files which I used previously. Previous config files were using the base distro as Ubuntu but now I've been possessed by the power of Arch Linux and by coming into the the decision of instead of using Ubuntu as my base distro switching to Arch Linux (Ohh yeah babyy!!)

Also the terminal of my choice is changed to "Alacritty" as idk why I just missed using alacritty though you're free to use any of the terminal emulators you want to use
Github link to alacritty : https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty

Some more updates in brief is the AUR helper that I'm using is "Paru" yes I know there is "Yay" as well you may use any of the helper you want.
Paru : https://github.com/morganamilo/paru

Here's a list of things or stuff you'll need if you want to use my config's
TODOS:
* Alacritty - terminal emulator of my choice
* Nitrogen - for setting wallpapers
* Picom - my goto compositor
* Rofi - my application launcher 
* Dmenu - yes I even have dmenu though you can skip this (i don't use this)
* Firefox - do I need to even specify this
* PcmanFm - Graphical file manager of my choice

You can find all of the above in the Arch/Arch User-Repositories.
Some of the font I've used for the above configs are -
* Inconsolata - https://aur.archlinux.org/nerd-fonts-inconsolata.git
* JetBrains Mono - https://aur.archlinux.org/ttf-jetbrains-mono-git.git
* Hack - https://aur.archlinux.org/nerd-fonts-hack.git
* Fira Code - https://aur.archlinux.org/nerd-fonts-fira-code.git
* Iosevka - https://aur.archlinux.org/ttf-iosevka.git

So yeah that's it!!!! Enjoy and Happy ricing!!
